# 1)Kedane's Algorithm:
Kadane’s algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm in which we search for a maximum sum contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array.
A simple idea of Kadane’s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array and keep track of the maximum sum contiguous subarray among all positive segments.

Time Complexity: O(N)

Space Complexity: O(1)
